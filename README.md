# alcometer
Assignment for course IN00CT08-3003

This is an alcometer application created with create-expo-app.
The application is optimized for iOS. Probably won't work properly on Android, as the app contains a dropdown menu only for iOS devices.

In the application user can enter their weight, choose from a dropdown menu how many bottles (of beer) they have drank and how many hours have passed since first bottle.
User can then choose their gender using radio buttons and after pressing 'calculate' button, the amount of promilles in their blood is shown.
The result is shown with color codes as follow:
- less than .22 -> result shown in green
- more or exactly .22 but less than .5 -> result shown in yellow
- .5 or more -> result shown in red.
